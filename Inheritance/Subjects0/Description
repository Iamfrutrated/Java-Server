This folder is also about inheritance.

The class with the main method is the SubjectsTester0 class. It gives data to the other classes through methods related to inheritance,
and it outputs a line of output each time it cycles through the classes. This contains more classes than Staffing0, therefore making it
more complex as there are more things to follow to understand the code.
